# Feng CHEN （陈 峰）
### Ph.D. HKUST
### Analog and Power Management IC Designer

## BIOGRAPHY
Feng Chen received the B.Eng. degree in [electronic and information engineering](http://www.isee.zju.edu.cn/_s413/main.psp) from [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/english) (ZJU), Hangzhou, China, in 2015, and the Ph.D. degree in [electronic and computer engineering](https://ece.hkust.edu.hk) from [The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk) (HKUST), Hong Kong, China, in 2020.
He is currently with [Silergy Corp.](https://www.silergy.com), Hangzhou, China. His current research interests involve [power management IC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_management_integrated_circuit) (PMIC) design and analog and [mixed-signal IC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed-signal_integrated_circuit) design, especially analog and digital [linear regulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regulator).
Dr. Chen was a recipient of the [HKUST postgraduate studentship](https://pg.ust.hk/current-students/awards-and-grants/postgraduate-studentship) from 2015 to 2020.
